Project looking at force plate and loadsole data to answer the question: 

Are there biomechanical differences in the loadsole plantar pressure related variables between walking and running force plate data?

The final report is labeled: Plantar_Pressure_TY.pdf

Equipment used: 
- One force platform (1200 Hz, BP600600, AMTI)
- One pair of plantar pressure insole system (Loadsol, 200 Hz)
- 3D motion analysis system (240 Hz, VICON)
- Visual3D (C-Motion, Inc.)
- Microsoft Office Excel

Content for Visual3D: 
- PP_Script_TY.v3s is the script
- PP_TY.cmz is the cmz
- test model.mdh is the model
- Static.c3d is the static file the model was applied to 
- PP_TY.xlsm is where the tables were created (text data files also attached)
