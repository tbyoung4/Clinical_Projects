Project looking at EMG and force plate data to answer the question: 

What is the relationship of the ensemble EMG signals muscle activation time histories of walking and running gait during the stance phase?

The final report is labeled: EMG_Report_TY.pdf

Equipment used: 
- 16-channel wireless EMG system (Delsys, USA) 
- One force platform (1200 Hz, BP600600, AMTI)
- 3D motion analysis system (240 Hz, VICON)
- Customized muscle testing chair 
- Visual3D (C-Motion, Inc.)
- Microsoft Office Excel

Content for Visual3D: 
- CMJ.rgt is the report (Can also be read by the 4 PNG files)
- EMG_TY.v3s is the script 
- Model.mdh is the model
- Static.c3d is the static file the model was applied to 
- The cmz file was too big to upload, but can be created by running the script
