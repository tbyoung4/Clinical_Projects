Project looking at EMG and force plate data with a cycle to answer the question: 

Are there lower extremity biomechanical differences in the power phase of cycling?

The final report is labeled: Cycle_EMG_TY.pdf

Equipment used: 
- 16-channel wireless EMG system (Delsys, USA)
- Two force platform (1200 Hz, BP600600, AMTI)
- Lode cycle ergometer and a pair of instrumented pedals
- Customized muscle testing chair
- 3D motion analysis system (240 Hz, VICON)
- Visual3D (C-Motion, Inc.)
- Microsoft Office Excel

Content for Visual3D: 
- Cycle_Muscles_TY.rgt is the report for cycle conditions (Can also be read by the 2 PNG files)
- Cycle_TY.v3s is the script for cycling conditions
- Cycle_TY_Final.cmz is the cmz for the cycling conditions 
- test model bike.mdh is the model
- Static.c3d is the static file the model was applied to 
- ROM and EMG.xlsx is where the tables were created
