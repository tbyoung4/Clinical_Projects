Content for Visual3D: 
- Report_TY.rgt is the report for gait conditions (Can also be read by the 2 PNG files)
- Script_TY.v3s is the script for gait conditions
- CMZ_TY.cmz is the cmz for gait conditions 
- test model foot.mdh is the model
- static.c3d is the static file the model was applied to 
- Metrics.xlsx is where the tables were created
