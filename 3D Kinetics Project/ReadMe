Project looking at force plate data to answer the question: 

Are there biomechanical differences performed by the ankle and knee muscle groups, and COP in level walking and stair ascent movements?

The final report is labeled: 3DKinetics_and_COP_TY.pdf

Equipment used: 
- Two force platform (1200 Hz, BP600600, AMTI)
- Instrumented staircase (AMTI) and customized staircase
- 3D motion analysis system (240 Hz, VICON)
- Visual3D (C-Motion, Inc.)
- Microsoft Office Excel

Content for Visual3D: 
- Walk_TY.rgt is the report for walking conditions (Can also be read by the 3 PNG files)
- Walk_TY.v3s is the script for walking conditions
- Walk.cmz is the cmz for the walking conditions 
- Stair_TY.rgt is the report for stair conditions (Can also be read by the 3 PNG files)
- Stair_TY.v3s is the script for stair conditions
- Stair.cmz is the cmz for the stair conditions 
- test model.mdh is the model
- Static.c3d is the static file the model was applied to 
- Workbook_TY.xlsx is where the tables were created
